        <h2>Key Concepts & Definitions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Creative Currency Octaves (CCO)</dt>
            <dd>A dual-currency economic system that provides universal basic income through restricted 'basic units' while maintaining strong work incentives through a productive conversion system. Named for the octave-like doubling pattern of conversion capacities across advancement levels.</dd>
            <dd>Key Components: Basic units (universal distribution), Octave levels (doubling capacity tiers), Personal multiplier rates (1x-14x based on contribution quality), Conversion system (expired units to primary currency)</dd>
            
            <dt>Public Trust Housing (PTH)</dt>
            <dd>Community-owned housing model that creates pathways for collective wealth building while providing stable, affordable housing. Properties are held in public trust and owned collectively by residents through democratic governance structures.</dd>
            <dd>Key Features: Democratic resident control, Housing Equity Accounts, Integrated services (childcare, healthcare, education), Collective wealth building</dd>
            <dd>Note: PTH complements rather than replaces the private real estate market, offering an additional housing option alongside traditional homeownership and rental markets.</dd>
            
            <dt>Basic Units</dt>
            <dd>The foundational currency units in the CCO system. Distributed universally to all community members, pegged 1:1 to primary currency, but restricted to essential expenditures (housing, food, healthcare, education, transportation). They expire at the end of each distribution cycle.</dd>
            <dd>Implementation: Basic units can be distributed digitally for debit card use, as well as printed at ATMs as receipt-paper currency with QR scan codes for cash transactions.</dd>
            
            <dt>Creative Collectives</dt>
            <dd>Community-organized groups of artists, creators, and cultural contributors within the CCO system who collaborate on projects, share resources, and collectively advance through octave levels. Creative Collectives receive enhanced recognition and multiplier rates for collaborative artistic and cultural work that benefits the broader community.</dd>
            <dd>Key Functions: Collaborative project management, Resource sharing, Peer mentorship, Community cultural programming, Collective octave advancement</dd>
            
            <dt>Octave Levels</dt>
            <dd>Progressive advancement tiers in the CCO system that determine conversion capacity levels. Each octave level doubles the previous level's conversion capacity (Base_Capacity Ã— 2^n). Named after musical octaves due to the doubling frequency pattern.</dd>
            
            <dt>Welfare Cliffs</dt>
            <dd>Economic phenomenon where earning additional income results in net loss due to benefit reduction, creating marginal tax rates exceeding 100%. CCO eliminates this by never reducing basic units regardless of other income.</dd>
            
            <dt>Social Zone Harmonization (SZH)</dt>
            <dd>A comprehensive framework for organizing communities and regions to optimize social, economic, and environmental outcomes through coordinated planning and resource allocation while maintaining local autonomy.</dd>
            
            <dt>Citizen Internet Portal (CIP)</dt>
            <dd>Digital infrastructure platform that enables democratic participation, transparent governance, and community-controlled economic systems. Facilitates CCO operations, PTH governance, and civic engagement through secure, privacy-focused technology.</dd>
