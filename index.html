        <h2>Key Concepts & Definitions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Creative Currency Octaves (CCO)</dt>
            <dd>A dual-currency economic system that provides universal basic income through 'basic units' while maintaining strong work incentives through a productive conversion system.</dd>
            <dd>Key Components: Basic units (universal distribution), Conversion system (expired units to primary currency), Octave levels (doubling capacity amounts), Personal conversion rates (1x-14x multiplier based on contribution quality)</dd>
            
            <dt>Basic Units</dt>
            <dd>The foundational currency units in the CCO system, pegged 1:1 to primary currency, and restricted to essential expenditures (housing, food, healthcare, education, transportation). They expire at the end of each distribution cycle.</dd>
            <dd>Implementation: Basic units can be distributed digitally for debit card use, as well as printed at ATMs as receipt-paper currency with QR scan codes for cash transactions.</dd>
            
            <dt>Creative Collectives</dt>
            <dd>Community-organized groups of artists, creators, and cultural contributors who administer the coversion of expired basic units into primary currency at elevated levels. Potential types include: Industry-specific, regional, local, age-based, rural, urban, etc. People may choose to opt-in by contributing productive value and sharing it positive ways. Creative Collective members receive enhanced recognition and elevated conversion rates for artistic, innovative, and cultural work that benefits the broader community.</dd>
            <dd>Key Functions: Collaborative project management, Resource sharing, Peer mentorship, Community cultural development, Collective octave advancement</dd>
            
            <dt>Octave Levels</dt>
            <dd>Progressive advancement tiers in the CCO system that determine conversion capacity levels. Named after musical octaves due to the doubling frequency pattern, each octave level doubles the previous level's conversion capacity (Base_Capacity Ã— 2^n).</dd>

            <dt>Public Trust Housing (PTH)</dt>
            <dd>Community-owned housing model that creates pathways for collective wealth building while providing stable, affordable housing. Properties are held in public trust and owned collectively by residents through democratic governance structures.</dd>
            <dd>Key Features: Democratic resident control, Housing Equity Accounts, Integrated services (childcare, healthcare, education), Collective wealth building</dd>
            <dd>Note: PTH complements rather than replaces the private real estate market, offering an additional housing option alongside traditional homeownership and rental markets.</dd>
            
            <dt>Social Zone Harmonization (SZH)</dt>
            <dd>A comprehensive framework for organizing communities and regions to optimize social, economic, and environmental outcomes through coordinated planning and resource allocation while maintaining local autonomy.</dd>
            
            <dt>Citizen Internet Portal (CIP)</dt>
            <dd>Digital infrastructure platform that enables democratic participation, transparent governance, and community-controlled economic systems. Facilitates CCO operations, PTH governance, and civic engagement through secure, privacy-focused technology.</dd>
