        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper analyzes Public Trust Housing's (PTH) potential to transform the U.S. real estate market through the innovative Acre Equity mechanism, which enables collective wealth building while maintaining housing affordability. We model market penetration scenarios demonstrating PTH could capture 15-20% of the housing market within a decade, creating $2.1 trillion in collective equity. The Acre Equity system allows residents to accumulate ownership stakes averaging $70,000 over 7 years while keeping housing costs 30% below market rates. Analysis of 142 metropolitan areas shows particular opportunity in high-cost coastal markets where PTH could provide middle-income housing options currently absent. The framework addresses the housing affordability crisis while creating pathways to wealth accumulation traditionally available only through individual homeownership. Implementation strategies include conversion of existing multifamily properties, new construction on public land, and employer-sponsored PTH development.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The U.S. real estate market faces dual crises: housing unaffordability affecting 38% of households and wealth inequality with median net worth varying 10-fold by race. Traditional homeownership, the primary wealth-building vehicle for middle-class Americans, has become inaccessible in major metropolitan areas where median home prices exceed $500,000.</p>
        <p>Public Trust Housing with the Acre Equity mechanism offers a transformative alternative: collective ownership that provides both affordability and wealth accumulation. This paper models PTH market penetration, analyzes the Acre Equity wealth-building mechanism, and demonstrates how PTH could reshape American housing markets.</p>

        <h2>2. The Acre Equity Mechanism</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Core Design</h3>
        <p>Acre Equity represents proportional ownership in PTH properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accumulation Rate:</strong> $500-1,500/month based on rent payments</li>
            <li><strong>Vesting Schedule:</strong> 20% annual vesting over 5 years</li>
            <li><strong>Transferability:</strong> Can sell to PTH or other residents</li>
            <li><strong>Appreciation Capture:</strong> 50% of property value increases</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Transfer equity between PTH properties</li>
        </ul>
