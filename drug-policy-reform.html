        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper examines drug policy reform through the lens of integrated economic governance, demonstrating how Creative Currency Octaves (CCO), Public Trust Housing (PTH), Citizen Internet Portal (CIP), and Social Zone Harmonization (SZH) systems create supportive frameworks for evidence-based drug policy. We present comprehensive cost accounting of current prohibition policies ($1.5 trillion over 25 years) versus regulated approaches integrated with CCO-PTH-CIP-SZH systems ($653 billion), revealing potential savings of $847 billion. Our analysis shows how CCO's merit-based conversion system can fund treatment services, PTH provides stable housing for recovery, CIP enables transparent regulation, and SZH coordinates regional responses. The integrated framework addresses root causes of substance abuse while eliminating criminal justice costs and generating tax revenue. Implementation modeling suggests 60% reduction in drug-related harm, 75% decrease in incarceration, and $180 billion annual economic benefit by year 10.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The United States has spent over $1 trillion on drug prohibition since 1971, with limited success in reducing drug use or related harms. Current approaches emphasize criminal justice responses despite evidence favoring public health interventions. This paper examines how integrated economic governance systems—Creative Currency Octaves, Public Trust Housing, Citizen Internet Portal, and Social Zone Harmonization—create opportunities for fundamental drug policy reform.</p>
        <p>The CCO-PTH-CIP-SZH framework addresses underlying socioeconomic factors driving substance abuse while providing alternatives to criminalization. By ensuring economic security, stable housing, community support, and coordinated services, this approach treats drug policy as a public health and economic issue rather than a criminal justice problem.</p>

        <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Drug policy reform within the CCO-PTH-CIP-SZH framework offers transformative potential for addressing substance abuse while generating substantial economic benefits. By treating drug use as a public health issue and addressing root socioeconomic causes, this integrated approach can save $847 billion over 25 years while dramatically improving health and social outcomes.</p>
        <p>The framework's emphasis on economic security, stable housing, transparent governance, and regional coordination creates conditions where evidence-based drug policy can flourish. Rather than perpetuating costly and ineffective prohibition, governments can invest in treatment, prevention, and harm reduction while generating tax revenue and reducing criminal justice expenditures.</p>
        <p>Implementation requires political courage but offers compelling returns: 60% reduction in drug-related harm, 75% decrease in incarceration, and $180 billion annual economic benefit by year 10. The CCO-PTH-CIP-SZH framework provides the infrastructure needed to make this transition successful and sustainable.</p>
